> ### Expedition Menu: An Outdoor Program Trip Menu Planner
>
> At CMU, the Outdoor Program(OP) is the headquarters for outdoor adventure and education. When preparing for a trip the OP creates a trip menu for everything they will be eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Doing this for multiple days with a constantly varying amount of people and different dietary restrictions can take a significant amount of time and manpower to create a menu and corresponding shopping list. We describe the development of a tool, Expedition Menu, that provides an easy to use interface for assisting in the creation of a trip menu from its database of recipes. It provides a scalable serving size adjuster for recipes to account for the varying trip group sizes. After describing the meal plans, Expedition Menu provides a printable version of the completed trip menu and shopping list.
